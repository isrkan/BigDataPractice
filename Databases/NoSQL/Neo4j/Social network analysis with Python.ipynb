    "# Neo4j and Cypher Basics with Python: Social Network Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will practice Neo4j, a graph database, to model a simple social network. We will cover the concepts of:\n",
    "- Connecting to a Neo4j database from Python\n",
    "- Creating nodes and relationships\n",
    "- Running Cypher queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a new project**:\n",
    "A project in Neo4j is a container for one or more databases. It helps to organize multiple databases that are related to a specific task, theme, or application. For example, we might have a project called \"Social Network\" that contains databases for development, testing, and production environments.\n",
    "   - Open Neo4j Desktop.\n",
    "   - Click on \"New\" under the \"Projects\" section.\n",
    "   - Name the project (e.g., \"Social Network\").\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Create a new database**:\n",
    "A database within a project is an actual instance where the graph data is stored. Each database has its own data and schema. For example, within the \"Social Network\" project, we might have a database named \"SocialNetworkDB\" where we store all user nodes and their relationships.\n",
    "   - Click on \"Add\" and choose \"Local DBMS\".\n",
    "   - Name your database (e.g., \"Social Network DBMS\"), set a password (e.g., \"SocialNetworkDBMS\"), and click \"Create\".\n",
