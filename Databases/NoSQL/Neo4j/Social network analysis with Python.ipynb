    "# Neo4j and Cypher Basics with Python: Social Network Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will practice Neo4j, a graph database, to model a simple social network. We will cover the concepts of:\n",
    "- Connecting to a Neo4j database from Python\n",
    "- Creating nodes and relationships\n",
    "- Running Cypher queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a new project**:\n",
    "A project in Neo4j is a container for one or more databases. It helps to organize multiple databases that are related to a specific task, theme, or application. For example, we might have a project called \"Social Network\" that contains databases for development, testing, and production environments.\n",
    "   - Open Neo4j Desktop.\n",
    "   - Click on \"New\" under the \"Projects\" section.\n",

    "**Create a new database**:\n",
    "A database within a project is an actual instance where the graph data is stored. Each database has its own data and schema. For example, within the \"Social Network\" project, we might have a database named \"SocialNetworkDB\" where we store all user nodes and their relationships.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Deleting a node with relationships: \n",
    "If the node has relationships, we must also handle those relationships. By default, Neo4j will not allow us to delete a node that still has relationships because it would leave dangling references in the graph. To delete a node and its relationships, you can use the `DETACH DELETE` command. This command removes the node and all relationships connected to it:\n",

    "    - `DELETE r`: Deletes the matched relationship.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Deleting bi-directional relationships: \n",

    "##### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Using `MERGE` to create or match nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MERGE (u:User {name: $name})`: Ensures that a node with the specified `name` exists. If a node with this `name` already exists, it will be matched. If not, a new `User` node will be created.  Unlike `CREATE`, which always creates a new node, `MERGE` will only create the node if it does not already exist. This prevents duplicate nodes.\n",
    "- `SET u.age = $age`: Updates the `age` property of the node. If the node was newly created, it sets the `age` property. If the node already existed, it updates the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Using `MERGE` for both nodes and relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MERGE (a:User {name: $follower/$name1})` and `MERGE (b:User {name: $followed/$name2})`: Ensure that both users/nodes exist in the database. creating them if they don't already exist.\n",
    "- `MERGE (a)-[:FOLLOW/FRIEND]->(b)`: Ensures that a specific relationship (FOLLOW/FRIEND) exists from `a` to `b`. If the relationship already exists, it is left unchanged; otherwise, it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Using `MATCH` with `MERGE` for Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MATCH (a:User {name: $follower/$name1})` and `MATCH (b:User {name: $followed/$name2})`: Find existing nodes in the database. If either node does not exist, this query will not create them.\n",
    "- `MERGE (a)-[:FOLLOW/FRIEND]->(b)`: Ensures that a specific relationship (FOLLOW/FRIEND) exists from `a` and `b`. If the relationship does not exist, it is created; otherwise, it is left unchanged. It will be executed depending on the `MATCH` results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison**:\n",
    "  - **`MATCH` + `MERGE`** allows for more control and it is useful if we are sure the nodes already exist and we want to ensure the relationship is created or matched. `MATCH` is used to find existing nodes or relationships but does not create them if they do not exist.\n",
    "  - **`MERGE` for both nodes and relationships** automatically handles the creation of nodes and relationships, which is simpler but may create nodes if they don't exist. `MERGE` is a combination of `MATCH` and `CREATE`. It will find the nodes and relationships if they exist or create them if they don't, making it more versatile for ensuring data integrity.\n",

    "  \n",
    "### Updating node properties\n",

    "##### Using the `CASE` clause\n",
    "The `CASE` clause is used to implement conditional logic within Cypher queries. It allows you to return different values based on specified conditions, similar to an `IF-THEN-ELSE` statement in other programming languages. In our example, `CASE` evaluates the `u.age` property for each user and returns a corresponding age group. The `WHEN` clauses define the conditions for different age groups: 'teenager', 'young adult', and 'adult'. The result set contains the user names and their respective age groups."
