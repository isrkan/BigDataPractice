    "- FAISS provides functions `faiss.write_index()` and `faiss.read_index()` to save and load indices to/from a file on disk.\n",
    "- The file extension for the saved index is usually `.faiss` (or any other custom extension), and FAISS can operate on these saved indices by loading them into memory when required.\n",
    "- The index is stored in a binary format, and FAISS handles the necessary operations to ensure it can be reloaded later in exactly the same state it was when saved.\n",
    "- FAISS can store the trained index on disk, but it requires vectors to be loaded into memory during the search. This means that the vectors we add to the index need to be in-memory when performing a search. That is different from other vaector databases such as Milvus, that can handle searches without needing the entire dataset to be loaded into memory. It supports both in-memory and disk-based indexing, so the index can stay on disk while being searched efficiently through an optimized data structure (like IVF or PQ).\n",
