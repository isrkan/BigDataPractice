    "# FAISS basics\n",
    "\n",
    "FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is widely used in applications involving nearest-neighbor search and large-scale machine learning. Common use cases include image search (finding similar images based on features), text search using embeddings (e.g., semantic similarity) and clustering high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core concept: Vector similarity search\n",
    "FAISS works with dense vectors. For example, a vector can represent:\n",
    "- An image (via image embeddings).\n",
    "- A document (via text embeddings like BERT).\n",
    "\n",
    "The library finds the nearest vectors (most similar vectors) to a given query vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key components:\n",
    "1. **Index:** A data structure used to store vectors for search.\n",
    "2. **Search:** A method to retrieve the nearest vectors based on a similarity metric (e.g., Euclidean or cosine similarity)."

    "FAISS provides several types of indices. The simplest one is the **IndexFlatL2**, which performs brute-force search using the L2 (Euclidean) distance. It stores all the data (vectors) in memory so that when we want to search for something, it directly compares our query with every vector in the dataset. Since it checks each vector individually, the search is guaranteed to be accurate, but it can be slower for larger datasets. IndexFlatL2 is ideal for small datasets, such as those with thousands of vectors, where precision is more important than speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"flat\" in the name means that all the vectors are stored in a simple, non-hierarchical way without any advanced indexing techniques such as additional structure like clustering or partitioning. This makes the structure \"flat,\" where every vector is directly accessible and compared individually during the search.\n",

    "IndexScalarQuantizer compresses vectors using scalar quantization. Each vector dimension is quantized (discretized) into a small number of values (quantization levels), reducing memory usage. Unlike PQ, which compresses chunks of dimensions, scalar quantization operates dimension by dimension. This is simpler and less memory-efficient than PQ, but it can still speed up searches while saving memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the exact values for each dimension, scalar quantization maps each dimension to a fixed number of levels (like rounding to a specific number of values).For example, if we have a vector with values like `[0.2, 0.5, 0.8]`, scalar quantization might map each value to a small set of possible values, such as `[0, 0.5, 1]`. This process reduces the precision of the vector, saving memory.\n",
